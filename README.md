# EyeExercise
This assigment was completed for the MIT xPro Fullstack Development with MERN certificate program. A Javascript onmousemove event, CSS, and HTML are combined to create an interactive page where the eyes follow the mouse around the page.

<h2>To Run:</h2>

<h2>Roadmap of future improvements:</h2>
I plan to come back to this project and eventually make it work on mobile devices. I will also be adding a pupil to make the eyes look more realistic.
